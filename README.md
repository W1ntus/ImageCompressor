# ImageCompressor
Image compressor tool made as a school project, written in C#. Utilizes discrete cosine transform commonly used in jpeg-compression.

The algorithmic structure could use some honing, since it's pretty heavy.

The program has a quite rare bug in its current state that causes crashing. Has something to do with the invoke/callback system, but I have no interest in fixing it right now.
